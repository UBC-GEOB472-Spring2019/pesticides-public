    <p> This essay delves into the context of how food, herbicides and degenerative diseases intersect. Firstly, this analysis will outline the scope of the issue and its significance. A guiding question for the following analysis will be understanding how degenerative diseases are linked to chemical usages in agricultural practices. This question is particularly important for understanding how cities in the future plan to feed their populations. Secondly, we will take a closer look specifically at the United States, focussing on pesticide concentrations in the Midwest. Lastly, this inquiry will look at the affects agricultural chemicals have on water quality and aquatic life.
</p>
<p>Historically, there has been quite the debate around the agricultural practices of conventional farming and the health of people and the planet. Additional justification for this inquiry comes from the fact that humanity is facing possibly the greatest challenge in its history. Population is expected to reach 9 billion in 2030. At the same time, agricultural land is becoming scarcer and poorer in quality (Gomeiro, 2008). Furthermore, the environmental impact of intensive agriculture and the effects of climate change are threatening food security in many regions of the globe. 815 million people are considered to be food insecure worldwide (FAO, 2018). Food insecurity refers to unstable access to proper nutrition for normal, healthy growth for an active lifestyle (FAO, 2018). Further, inadequate nutrition is affecting one and a half billion people worldwide, which includes a spectrum (fig.1) from malnourishment to obesity (FAO, 2018). On top of this, shortages of fossil fuels will have dramatic effects on the performance of intensive, conventional agriculture.

<p> TThis analysis focuses on glyphosate for two reasons. Firstly, glyphosate is the key ingredient in the herbicide, RoundUp®, which accounts for 53.5% of total agricultural herbicide use in the United States (Coupe & Capel, 2016). RoundUp® was first patented and introduced by Monsanto in 1974 for agricultural use (Coupe & Capel, 2016). Later it was marketed to consumers as a household herbicide. It is sprayed in staggering quantities on most commercially grown staple crops, including wheat, corn, soybean, beet, cotton, canola, and alfalfa (Samsel et al. 2013).</p>
  <p>Secondly, the increase in the usage of glyphosate or glyphosate based herbicides (GBH) is extremely well correlated with an increase in the incidence of many diseases, including cancers (Samsel et al. 2013). Numerous studies have shown the increasingly harmful results of consuming this herbicide that contains glyphosate. We found research articles linking glyphosate to all sorts of diseases, including <b>neoplastic</b> diseases (<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/article/study-suggests-augmented-risk-cutaneous-melanoma-among-subjects-exposure-pesti">melanoma</a>, <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/article/these-results-indicated-increased-leukemia-risk-among-children-residing-close-">childhood leukemia</a>,<a href="http://notoxicliving.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Glyphosate-pathways-modern-diseases.pdf">breast cancer, pancreatic cancer ,kidney cancer, thyroid cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer</a>), <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276017300656"><b>diabetes</b></a>, and <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/article/parkinsonism-after-chronic-occupational-exposure-glyphosate-has-been-reported"><b>Parkinsons</b></a>. We also found evidence to suggest that glyphosate is linked to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276017300656>celiac disease</a> as well as <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892036218300254">IBS</a>,  but we left these out of our mapping analysis as they’re more difficult to quantify since they don’t often cause deaths. However, there is still convincing statistical evidence that will be discussed later on. Our first interactive map focuses on understanding the prevalence of 3 categories of degenerative diseases throughout the americas; parkinson's, diabetes, and neoplastic diseases.

  </div>
        <p>In this visualization, “Population Suffering from Degenerative Diseases”, we were trying to show the correlation between degenerative diseases and pesticide use of the countries in the Americas’. We used DALY to show our data in the map as it is was more meaningful for our project. DALY stands for the disability-adjusted life years, which is a measure of overall disease burden, and it is expressed as the total number of years lost due to ill-health, disability, or early death. In our map we did not manage to obtain the results as countries like US showing higher DALY (5703819 years) with lower pesticide use (2.63 kg/ha), whereas countries like Argentina showing Lower DALY (63725 years) with higher pesticide use (5.17 kg/ha). This could be due to multiple factors that could have caused the degenerative diseases. Nevertheless, the concentrations of pesticides sprayed in countries like the US is still higher than the standard limit.
        </p>
        <p>Adding to the complexity and severity of this issue is the fact that these degenerative diseases are also taking route in people who are food secure. Exposures to glyphosate can trigger a cascade of biological effects that may culminate many years later in chronic degenerative diseases or other health problems (Myers et al. 2016). Exposures leading to serious complications later in life might occur over just a few days to a month in short-lived animals, and over a few days to several months in humans (Myers et al. 2016). Of particular interest to this analysis is the prevalence of glyphosate sprayed in the midwest of the United States, where the majority of staple crops, such as wheat, corn and soy, are grown. Meanwhile degenerative disease rates are much higher in this area relative to the rest of the country (US health. 2014). Fig. 2 shows the distribution of diabetes, kidney, and endocrine diseases, culminating in the Midwest where people are exposed to higher concentrations of GBHs in the air they breathe, the food they eat, and in the water they drink.

        <p>Our second map hones in on the United States. We take a look at the usage of glyphosate across the U.S. along with the prevalence of diabetes at the county level. This visualization uses proportional circles to represent the distribution and concentration of glyphosate, with an underlying choropleth showing the percentage of diabetes per county. Our goal here was to enable a map user to visualize a correlation between a disease and glyphosate.

        <p>The third visualization zooms in on an area that is known to be the largest dead zone in the ocean, where the water doesn't have enough oxygen to sustain aquatic life (Dybas, 2005). This dead zone is the result of excess runoff of fertilizer and herbicides from agriculture in the Mississippi River drainage basin, which encompasses midwestern states as far as Minnesota (Dybas, 2005). 4.5 billion pounds of glyphosate have been sprayed in the US between 1974 and 2018; the majority, sprayed on farmland within this area (Myers et al., 2016). More than 55% of agricultural lands are found in the river's drainage area (Dybas, 2005). The Mississippi River Delta map shows where toxic farm runoff and sediment culminates and then flows into the Gulf of Mexico. These chemicals also permeate the water table that many cities depend on for drinking water. Additionally, these chemicals are transported through the air by evapotranspiration, migrating onto organic farms as well as towns. The zoomable three dimensional visualisation offers a new perspectives where the users is able to see the elevation and water flow from all viewpoints.

		<h1 class="display-6">Causes of Diseases</h1>
    <p>  The prevalence of these degenerative diseases have all dramatically increased since the 1970s (Myers et al. 2016). These diseases all have something in common. The root cause of these health problems is inflammation in the body. Glyphosate damages the membrane barrier in the body that protects the inside from environmental toxins that people are exposed to (Samsel et al., 2013). This process then creates intestinal permeability, which results in your body inflaming the affected area (Samsel er al., 2015). This same process has made supposed gluten intolerances affect 5% of North Americans and Europeans (fig. 3), but it is often not the gluten that people are allergic to, it's actually the glyphosate in the wheat products that is causing these gut issues (Saamsel et al., 2013). While some propose the recent surge in celiac disease is due simply to better diagnostic tools, further research suggests it’s more than that. In 2009, research by Rubio-Tapia et al. looked for gluten antibodies in frozen immune serum obtained between 1948 and 1954 for gluten antibodies, and compared them with samples from people today. Their results found a 4-fold increase in the incidence of celiac disease in the younger generation. To combat this “leaking” response in the gut that causes enhanced chronic inflammation, one must repair gut health with unprocessed, fibrous foods. The trouble is finding these foods with “safe” levels of glyphosate contamination. Unfortunately, even organic food has found to have some glyphosate residue as cross contamination can happen through wind, rain and bee pollination (Arnason, 2019).

    <p> Meyers et al. (2016) sum up the main risks of using glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH), for health and also for the environment:</p>
	</div>
  <div class= "row padding">
<div class= "col-lg-7">
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>Glyphosate attaches to essential micronutrient metals such as zinc, cobalt and manganese, meaning that it can alter the availability of these micronutrients for crops, people, wildlife, pets, and livestock. The loss of these micronutrients can contribute to many harmful effects, especially kidney and liver function. </li>
  <li>Organisms such as fish, butterflies, earthworms, and soil microorganisms also face risks (not just us humans!)</li>
  <li>Soil & groundwater contamination: GBH pose a threat to soil health & fertility, which can adversely affect crop productivity</li>
  <li>Even low levels (50 ppb) of glyphosate have been shown to have significant negative effects on the aquatic invertebrate Daphnia magna. But the U.S. EPA’s maximum contaminant Level is 700 ppb, and the Canadian long-term freshwater aquatic standard is 800 ppb. The regulatory eco-toxicological risk levels for glyphosate are way too high!</li>

<div class="container-fluid padding">

	<div class="col-12">
		<h1 class="display-6">Looking Forward</h1>
    <p> In light of the increased numbers, levels and extent of herbicide use evoked by weed resistance, it is reasonable to predict that there will be a marked increase in the number and duration of high-exposure periods, and the magnitude of potential risks facing non-target organisms, including humans (Myers et al., 2016). Such impacts could be limited, or even largely prevented, if there are substantial changes in weed management systems and regulatory policy, including enforceable limits on herbicide-use patterns known to cause relatively high and potentially unsafe residue levels in food, water, and the air (Myers et al., 2016). In relation to public health and food planning, national health advisories need to take a hard look at the magnitude of diseases that have arisen since the time Monsanto’s Roundup® herbicide was introduced in 1974 (Myers et al. 2016). To combat this complex pandemic issue, food systems and health need to be closely studied, because modern diseases like obesity will be solved not by the medical profession, which is largely geared towards treating illness rather than promoting health (Morgan, 2009). Rather, solutions to diseases like obesity are more likely to be found in more sustainable urban environments where people are connected to where their food comes from and where public spaces provide nutritious food that is readily available and affordable to everyone, especially in poor neighbourhoods (Armendariz, Armenia, and Atzori, 2016).
