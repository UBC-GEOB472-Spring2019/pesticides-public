    <p> This essay delves into the context of how food, herbicides and degenerative diseases intersect. Firstly, this analysis will outline the scope of the issue and its significance. Guiding questions for the following analysis include understanding how degenerative diseases are linked to chemical usages in agricultural practices. This question is particularly important for understanding how cities in the future plan to feed their populations. Historically, there has been quite the debate around the agricultural practices of conventional farming and the health of people and the planet. Additional justification for this inquiry comes from the fact that humanity is facing possibly the greatest challenge in its history. Population is expected to reach 9 billion in 2030. At the same time, agricultural land is becoming scarcer and poorer in quality (Gomeiro, 2008). Furthermore, the environmental impact of intensive agriculture and the effects of climate change are threatening food security in many regions of the globe. 815 million people are considered to be food insecure (FAO, 2018). Food insecurity refers too unstable access to proper nutrition for normal, healthy growth for an active lifestyle (FAO, 2018). Further, inadequate nutrition is affecting one and a half billion people worldwide (which includes a spectrum (fig.1) from malnourishment to obesity; FAO, 2018) and is very observable on a daily basis (Cutts, Darby, Boone, & Brewis, 2009). On top of this, shortages of fossil fuels will have dramatic effects on the performance of intensive agriculture.

<p> This analysis focuses on glyphosate for two reasons. Firstly, glyphosate is the key ingredient in the herbicide, RoundUp®, which accounts for 53.5% of total agricultural herbicide use in the United States (USGS, 2009). RoundUp® was first patented and introduced by Monsanto in 1974 for agricultural use (USGS, 2009). Later it was marketed to consumers as a household herbicide. It is sprayed in staggering quantities on most commercially grown staple crops, including wheat, corn, soybean, beet, cotton, canola, and alfalfa (Samsel et al. 2013).</p>
  <p>Secondly, the increase in the usage of glyphosate or glyphosate based herbicides (GBH) is extremely well correlated with an increase in the incidence of many diseases, including cancers (Samsel et al. 2013). Numerous studies have shown the increasingly harmful results of consuming this herbicide that contains glyphosate. We found research articles linking glyphosate to all sorts of diseases, including <b>neoplastic</b> diseases (<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/article/study-suggests-augmented-risk-cutaneous-melanoma-among-subjects-exposure-pesti">melanoma</a>, <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/article/these-results-indicated-increased-leukemia-risk-among-children-residing-close-">childhood leukemia</a>,<a href="http://notoxicliving.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Glyphosate-pathways-modern-diseases.pdf">breast cancer, pancreatic cancer ,kidney cancer, thyroid cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer</a>), <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276017300656"><b>diabetes</b></a>, and <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/article/parkinsonism-after-chronic-occupational-exposure-glyphosate-has-been-reported"><b>Parkinsons</b></a>. We also found evidence to suggest that glyphosate is linked to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276017300656>celiac disease</a> as well as <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892036218300254">IBS</a>, but we left these out of our project as they’re more difficult to quantify since they don’t often cause deaths. Our first interactive map focuses on understanding the prevalence of 3 categories of degenerative diseases throughout the americas; parkinson's, diabetes, and neoplastic diseases.

        <p>In our first map, “Population Suffering from Degenerative Diseases”, we were trying to show the correlation between degenerative diseases and pesticide use of the countries in the Americas’. We used DALY to show our data in the map as it is was more meaningful for our project. DALY stands for the disability-adjusted life years, which is a measure of overall disease burden, and it is expressed as the total number of years lost due to ill-health, disability, or early death. In our map we did not manage to obtain the results as countries like US showing higher DALY (5703819 years) with lower pesticide use (2.63 kg/ha), whereas countries like Argentina showing Lower DALY (63725 years) with higher pesticide use (5.17 kg/ha). This could be due to multiple factors that could have caused the degenerative diseases. Nevertheless, the concentrations of pesticides sprayed in countries like the US is still higher than the standard limit.
        </p>
        <p>Adding to the complexity and severity of this issue, is the fact that these degenerative diseases are also taking route in people who are food secure. Exposures to glyphosate can trigger a cascade of biological effects that may culminate many years later in chronic degenerative diseases or other health problems (Myers et al. 2016). Exposures leading to serious complications later in life might occur over just a few days to a month in short-lived animals, and over a few days to several months in humans (Myers et al. 2016). Of particular interest to this analysis is the prevalence of glyphosate sprayed in the midwest of the United States, where the majority of staple crops, such as wheat, corn and soy, are grown. Meanwhile degenerative disease rates are much higher in this area relative to the rest of the country (US health. 2014). Fig. 2 shows the distribution of diabetes, kidney, and endocrine diseases, culminating in the Midwest where people are exposed to higher concentrations of GBHs in the air they breathe, the food they eat, and in the water they drink.

		<h1 class="display-6">Summary of Risks (Meyers et al., 2016)</h1>
    <p> Meyers et al. (2016) sum up the main risks of using glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH), for health and also for the environment:</p>
	</div>

</div>
</div>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>Glyphosate attaches to essential micronutrient metals such as zinc, cobalt and manganese, meaning that it can alter the availability of these micronutrients for crops, people, wildlife, pets, and livestock. The loss of these micronutrients can contribute to many harmful effects, especially kidney and liver function. </li>
  <li>Organisms such as fish, butterflies, earthworms, and soil microorganisms also face risks (not just us humans!)</li>
  <li>Soil & groundwater contamination: GBH pose a threat to soil health & fertility, which can adversely affect crop productivity</li>
  <li>Even low levels (50 ppb) of glyphosate have been shown to have significant negative effects on the aquatic invertebrate Daphnia magna. But the U.S. EPA’s maximum contaminant Level is 700 ppb, and the Canadian long-term freshwater aquatic standard is 800 ppb. The regulatory eco-toxicological risk levels for glyphosate are way too high!</li>

		<h1 class="display-6">What is it that's causing disease?</h1>
    <p> -Late 1990/2000s surges in autistic children 1/36 children.
 Maybe there is a root cause of all disease? Things brings us back to the food chain..Inflammation is behind chronic issues.. What is inflammation? the membrane between your outside world and insides…
We started disrespecting topsoil care in farming practices...we need to look at how the environment actually functions instead of trying to engineer it differently….this has happened more and more because we are disconnected from our growing our food.
Chemical based fertilizers were started to be made in 1960s plants became greeners from the fertilizer but they were lacking nutrients that they usually have, and the plants became weak and then the farmers became dependent on the fertilizers to keep up.
Round up: 4.5 billions pounds of glyphosate (2018).. patented as an antibiotic first.
Runnoff and aquifers now contaminated and

Before roundup was used in conventional farming, monsanto adversized this herbicide to be used by home owner

2012: found when evidence got so overwhelming..found that same bacteria cells in the soil look the same as the cancer cells. Turns out the gut layers that contain good bacterias, but glyphosate is actually permeating and breaking the down the gut lining that holds your gut lining together is the only layer between your stomach and your immune systems. This same process is what people think is why they need to avoid gluten..but turns out it's not the gluten that people are allergic to, it's actually the glyphosate that is causing them problems.
Enhanced chronic inflammatory response that are “leaking” in your gut that can only be repaired if your repair your gut..

In addition to resistance, concerns have been raised about the toxicity of herbicide mixtures, because current data suggest that chemicals in combination can have effects that are not predicted from tests of single compounds [40, 41]. GBHs themselves are chemical mixtures; in addition to the inclusion of glyphosate (the active ingredient), these herbicides include adjuvants such as surfactants, which can make GBH-product formulations more toxic than glyphosate alone [42–44]. In light of the increased numbers, levels and extent of herbicide use elicited by weed resistance, it is reasonable to predict that there will be a marked increase in the diversity of biological pathways affected, the number and duration of high-exposure periods, and the magnitude of potential risks facing non-target organisms, including humans. Such impacts could be limited, or even largely prevented, if there are substantial changes in weed management systems and regulatory policy, including enforceable limits on herbicide-use patterns known to cause relatively high and potentially unsafe residue levels in food, water, and the air.l( Concerns over use of glyphosate-based herbicides and risks associated with exposures: a consensus statement, myers, et al 2016)

		<h1 class="display-6">Looking Forward</h1>
    <p> Organic farming does not use these toxic herbicides, but escaping the impacts of them is harder than just eating organic foods. A larger percentage of the GBH’s and other pesticides sprayed, end up in water run off and as well as in the air, through evapotranspiration. These chemicals then permeate the water table that many cities depend on for drinking water. Additionally, these chemicals are transported through the air, migrating onto organic farms as well as towns. While this is a rather defeating reality, there is still some optimism even though glyphosate is water soluble </p>
