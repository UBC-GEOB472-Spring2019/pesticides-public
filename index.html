    <p> This essay delves into the context of how food, herbicides and degenerative diseases intersect. Firstly, this analysis will outline the scope of the issue and its significance. Guiding questions for the following analysis include understanding how degenerative diseases are linked to chemical usages in agricultural practices. And, how do we explain the significance between agricultural runoff and water quality, which impacts aquatic biodiversity and human drinking water? These big questions are particularly important for understanding how cities in the future plan to feed their populations. Historically, there has been quite the debate around the agricultural practices of conventional farming and health of people and the planet. Additional justification for this inquiry comes from the fact that humanity is facing possibly the greatest challenge in its history. Population is expected to reach 9 billion in 2030. At the same time, agricultural land is becoming scarcer and poorer in quality (Gomeiro, 2008). Furthermore, the environmental impact of intensive agriculture and the effects of climate change are threatening food security in many regions of the globe. (define food security + food insecurity spectrum) On top of this, shortages of fossil fuels will have dramatic effects on the performance of intensive agriculture.
This analysis focuses on glyphosate for two reasons. Firstly, glyphosate is the active ingredient in the herbicide, RoundUp®, which is the most important causal factor in this health epidemic (Samsel, 2013). Secondly, glyphosate accounts for the 53.5% of total agricultural herbicide use (USGS, 2009). RoundUp® was first patented and introduced by Monsanto in 1974 for agricultural use. Later it was marketed to consumers as a household herbicide. It is sprayed in staggering quantities on most commercially grown staple crops, including wheat, corn, soybean, beet, cotton, canola, and alfalfa (Samsel et al., 2013). Numerous studies have shown the increasingly harmful results of consuming this herbicide that contains glyphosate. Research shows a strong correlation between multifactorial disease associated with numerous nutritional deficiencies as well as reproductive issues and increased risk to all sorts of cancers (citation). Research has confirmed linkages between these farming toxins and thyroid cancer kidney failure and cancer. How come? The route issue with cancer cell production is inflammation (citation).

In relation to public health and food planning, national health advisories need to take a hard look at the magnitude of diseases that have risen since the time Monsanto’s Roundup® herbicide was introduced in 1974 (citation). Inadequate nutrition is affecting one and a half billion people worldwide (which includes malnourishment and obesity; FAO, 2018) and  is  very observable (Cutts,  Darby,  Boone, & Brewis, 2009). One of the biggest driving factors of inadequate nutrition is big box stores that affect independent shops, food security,  public  health,  and  vitality  of  inner-city  areas, all of which are prevalent and observable to society on a daily basis (Morgan, 2009). Further, these big box stores contain large amounts of processed foods as well as fruits and vegetables that are found to contain herbicides (Samsel et al., 2013). To combat this complex pandemic issue, food systems and health need to be closely studied, because modern diseases like obesity will be solved not by the medical profession, which is largely geared towards treating illness rather than promoting health (Morgan, 2009). Rather, solutions to diseases like obesity are more likely to be found in more sustainable urban environments where people are connected to where their food comes from and where public spaces provide nutritious food that is readily available and affordable to everyone, especially in poor neighbourhoods (Armendariz, Armenia, and Atzori, 2016).  Adding to the complexity and severity of this issue, is the fact that these degenerative diseases are also taking route in people who are food secure. Exposures to glyphosate can trigger a cascade of biological effects that may culminate many years later in chronic degenerative diseases or other health problems (Myers et al. 2016). Exposures leading to serious complications later in life might occur over just a few days to a month in short-lived animals, and over a few days to several months in humans (Myers et al. 2016). Of particular interest to this analysis is the prevalence of glyphosate sprayed in the midwest of the United States, where the majority of staple crops, such as wheat, corn and soy, are grown an
Our research and interactive maps will focus on understanding the distribution of this chemical in air pollution as well as in runoff water in the US. </p>

		<h1 class="display-6">Summary of Environmental Risks from Meyers et al. 2016</h1>
    <p> -This overview of possible adverse effects associated with rising GBH use is focused on mammalian health risks. There are also many environmental and soil-ecosystem problems associated with heavy and repeated uses of GBHs affecting other organisms (for example, fish, butterflies, earthworms, beneficial soil microorganisms)
    -These problems arise from the large volumes of GBHs applied across vast areas in many farming areas (for example, 80% or more of the harvested cropland in many counties in the U.S., and provinces or political jurisdictions in other countries, are sprayed with GBHs)
  -Glyphosate binds strongly to some soils, but not others. After repeated applications, it can accumulate and become a long-term source of soil and groundwater contamination [48]. The main pathways of GBH degradation are known and the principal breakdown products (AMPA, formaldehyde) could be toxic to a variety of non-target organisms. Continued long-term use of GBHs could pose a threat to soil health and fertility [47, 49], with possible adverse effects on crop productivity.
-Low levels (50 ppb) of glyphosate have been shown to have significant negative effects on the aquatic invertebrate Daphnia magna [50]. When measured against the U.S. EPA’s Maximum Contaminant Level of 700 ppb, or the Canadian short-term (27,000 ppb) and the long-term (800 ppb) freshwater aquatic standards [51], one quickly sees how the regulatory eco-toxicological risk levels set for glyphosate are orders of magnitude too high.
 Glyphosate attaches to essential micronutrient metals such as zinc, cobalt and manganese. This property of GBHs can alter the availability of these micronutrients for crops, people, wildlife, pets, and livestock. These micronutrient metals are enzymatic cofactors, so their loss has the potential to contribute to a number of harmful effects, especially on kidney and liver function

    <p> -Late 1990/2000s surges in autistic children 1/36 children.
 Maybe there is a root cause of all disease? Things brings us back to the food chain..Inflammation is behind chronic issues.. What is inflammation? the membrane between your outside world and insides…
We started disrespecting topsoil care in farming practices...we need to look at how the environment actually functions instead of trying to engineer it differently….this has happened more and more because we are disconnected from our growing our food.
Chemical based fertilizers were started to be made in 1960s plants became greeners from the fertilizer but they were lacking nutrients that they usually have, and the plants became weak and then the farmers became dependent on the fertilizers to keep up.
Round up: 4.5 billions pounds of glyphosate (2018).. patented as an antibiotic first.
Runnoff and aquifers now contaminated and

Before roundup was used in conventional farming, monsanto adversized this herbicide to be used by home owner

2012: found when evidence got so overwhelming..found that same bacteria cells in the soil look the same as the cancer cells. Turns out the gut layers that contain good bacterias, but glyphosate is actually permeating and breaking the down the gut lining that holds your gut lining together is the only layer between your stomach and your immune systems. This same process is what people think is why they need to avoid gluten..but turns out it's not the gluten that people are allergic to, it's actually the glyphosate that is causing them problems.
Enhanced chronic inflammatory response that are “leaking” in your gut that can only be repaired if your repair your gut..

In addition to resistance, concerns have been raised about the toxicity of herbicide mixtures, because current data suggest that chemicals in combination can have effects that are not predicted from tests of single compounds [40, 41]. GBHs themselves are chemical mixtures; in addition to the inclusion of glyphosate (the active ingredient), these herbicides include adjuvants such as surfactants, which can make GBH-product formulations more toxic than glyphosate alone [42–44]. In light of the increased numbers, levels and extent of herbicide use elicited by weed resistance, it is reasonable to predict that there will be a marked increase in the diversity of biological pathways affected, the number and duration of high-exposure periods, and the magnitude of potential risks facing non-target organisms, including humans. Such impacts could be limited, or even largely prevented, if there are substantial changes in weed management systems and regulatory policy, including enforceable limits on herbicide-use patterns known to cause relatively high and potentially unsafe residue levels in food, water, and the air.l( Concerns over use of glyphosate-based herbicides and risks associated with exposures: a consensus statement, myers, et al 2016)

		<h1 class="display-6">Looking Forward</h1>
    <p> Organic farming does not use these toxic herbicides, but escaping the impacts of them is harder than just eating organic foods. A larger percentage of the GBH’s and other pesticides sprayed, end up in water run off and as well as in the air, through evapotranspiration. These chemicals then permeate the water table that many cities depend on for drinking water. Additionally, these chemicals are transported through the air, migrating onto organic farms as well as towns. While this is a rather defeating reality, there is still some optimism even though glyphosate is water soluble </p>
